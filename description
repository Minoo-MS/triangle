The project is built with Angular CLI 7 ,
All the logical methods are placed in Service and the structure is shown by foldering Component,Services,Models(we dont have any model here).
The approach of Model Driven Forms(Reactive Forms) is chosen to implement the form as it is much more powerful,
more complex validation logic is actually simpler to implement using them and we can unit test the form validation logic.
The bootstrap and its style is used here.
I also wrote some unit tests for the main component to test the form,validation and methods of service
